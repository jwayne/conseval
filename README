===Dependencies===

Python 2.6.*, 2.7.*
numpy
biopython
PyYAML (for parsing config files)
PhyML (for computing phylogenetic trees)


===Getting started===

This code supports the following functions:

- Computing conservation rates on alignments stored as CLUSTAL or
  FASTA files using multiple methods.  Example usage:

  # Compute conservation rates using the default mayrose04 method.
  ./singlerun.py examples/1dup_A_hssp-filtered.aln

  # Compute conservation rates using the mayrose04 method and also
  # compute conservation scores using the Jensen-Shannon divergence
  # method.
  ./singlerun.py examples/1dup_A_hssp-filtered.aln -s mayrose04 -s js_divergence

  # Help
  ./singlerun.py -h

  Available inference methods can be found in 'scorers/'.  See
  the paper (TBD) for a description of these methods.

- (TBD)
  Running experiments on the efficacy of the conservation rate
  inference methods available in this package.  These experiments
  compute conservation rates of alignments in parallel, and assess
  the results with test data paired with the input alignments via
  (TBD) methods.  Example usage:

  ./experiment.py -d all -s mayrose04

- Computing phylogenetic trees for all alignment files in a given
  directory, in parallel.

===Advanced customization===

(TBD)

The substitution rate matrix files are stored in 'substitution/', and can be
customized.
